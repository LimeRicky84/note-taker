# Note Taker Application

This app gives the user an interface where they can take notes and store them in a JSON file to be recalled
at another time, and then deleted when they are no longer wanted/needed.

## Usage

Type in a title and body of a note, click save icon.  Each saved note can be reopened by clicking the title
in the column on the left, or deleted by clicking the red delete icon next to the note.
